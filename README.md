# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not consistently applied to elements. The issue is intermittent and affects only specific classes, even after verifying the configuration and class names.

## Bug Description

The bug is characterized by the inconsistent application of Tailwind CSS classes. Some classes are applied correctly, while others are ignored, even though they appear to be correctly defined in the configuration and used within the code.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the inconsistent application of Tailwind CSS classes in the browser.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the Tailwind directives are correctly included in the CSS entry point and that the CSS is properly imported into the HTML or JSX files.  Additional debugging steps might include inspecting the generated CSS output to ensure that the problematic classes are being compiled correctly.
