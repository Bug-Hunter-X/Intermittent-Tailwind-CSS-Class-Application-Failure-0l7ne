// Ensure that your Tailwind directives are correctly placed in your CSS entry point (e.g., `tailwind.config.js` and your CSS file) and imported correctly.
// ...Tailwind directives (e.g., @tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;)

// In your HTML file (or within JSX, depending on the setup) 
<div class="bg-red-500 p-4">This div should now have a red background and padding.</div>

// Check the generated CSS to confirm the classes exist and are properly compiled.
// Verify the order of the classes and CSS import in your code to avoid conflicts.
